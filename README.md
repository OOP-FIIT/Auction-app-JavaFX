# Online advertisement auction
A VCG auction is used to sell advertising spaces on Internet sites. Facebook and Google (in their partner network use this auction model. This is blind auction, so nobody sees another’s bid. Also, it is second-price type of auction. All the possible combinations of bids are then considered by the auction system, and the one maximizing the total sum of bids is kept, but winners pay second price. There are few spaces for advertisement to sell And everybody could do a few bids, for example you may bet 10$ for 1 slot, 15$ for 2 slots and 100 for all 20 slots of advertisement.
